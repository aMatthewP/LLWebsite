    <h2>Definition of Streaming</h2>
    <p>Streaming is the act of being able to consume media content and being able to play it in an instant without having to download it first. Whether it be pre-recorded or live, it can still be considered streamed content as long as it can be played on any device via the internet.</p>
   
    <h2>Types of Streaming Content</h2>
    <p>The common forms or types of streamed content are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Video Games - is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device to generate visual feedback from a display device.</li>
      <li>Music Videos - sometimes abbreviated to MV or M/V, is a video that integrates a song or an album with imagery that is produced for promotional or musical artistic purposes.</li>
      <li>TV Shows - is the general reference to any content produced for viewing on a television set that is broadcast via over-the-air, satellite, or cable.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Platforms used for Streaming</h2>
    <p>Some platforms that can be used for streaming are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Twitch - Twitch is a live streaming platform for gamers. The primary focus on Twitch is video games.</li>
      <li>Facebook - Facebook Live is a feature of Facebook that lets users livestream directly to the social network platform.</li>
      <li>YouTube - YouTube Live assists users in broadcasting their content on a real-time basis via the YouTube channel.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Viewers Analysis for Each Streaming Category</h2>
    <p>When performing a viewers or audience analysis, we need to get their demographic information such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gender:</strong> It is vital to supporting and progressing gender equality and will contribute substantially to lifting population health.</li>
      <li><strong>Age:</strong> To help know more about what type of content the specific age frequently watch.</li>
      <li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Allows you to better understand certain background characteristics of an audience.</li>
      <li><strong>Nationality:</strong> To know where they are located and to know the specific content of what the country wants.</li>
      <li><strong>Education:</strong> Education is often strongly associated with fertility, mortality, and migration experiences.</li>
      <li><strong>Employment:</strong> Employment is defined as persons of working age who, during a short reference period, were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit.</li>
      <li><strong>Household Income:</strong> The combined gross income of all members of a household above a specified age.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Need of Viewers</h2>
    <p>People watch streaming content for informational and educational purposes. Games and TV shows make up streaming's entertainment aspect. On the other hand, informational/educational sources, such as the media and learning channels, convey information about things we do not currently know.</p>


    <h2>Characteristics of a Good Stream</h2>
    <p>A good stream, whether it's a live video stream, a water stream, or any other type, typically exhibits the following characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> A reliable and consistent flow is important. In the case of live video streams, this means a stable and uninterrupted broadcast.</li>
      <li><strong>Quality:</strong> High-resolution video and clear audio are essential for a good live video stream. In a natural water stream, water quality is important for the ecosystem it supports.</li>
      <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Interaction with the audience or ecosystem can make a stream more engaging. In the case of live video, this might involve responding to comments or questions.</li>
    </ul>
